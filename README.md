## History 
This project started way back in 2023 as [pwdl](https://github.com/shubhamakshit/pwdl). It was then merely a script for downloading segments using a loophole in pw's api. When it got pached we moved on to [pwdlv2](https://github.com/shubhamakshit/pwdlv2) in March, 2024. It was mostly haphazard code. pwdlv3 started in April, 2024 as is proudly growing ever since.
